Thank you. This concludes the experiment. The round chosen for payment was {{ player.pay_round }}. The earnings rate is {{ Constants.payment_rate }}. In that round, you completed {{ player.num_key_pairs }} pairs on the keyboard so you earned {{Constants.payment_rate }} * {{ player.num_key_pairs }} = ${{ player.piecerate_payment }} from the keyboard task.

Your total earnings for this experiment today are:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>${{ Constants.showup_fee }}</td>
		<td>Show-up fee</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$4.00</td>
		<td>Completion fee</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>{{ player.piecerate_payment</td><td>Earnings from keyboard task</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>{{ player.payoff }}</td><td>Total payment</td>
	</tr>
</table>
