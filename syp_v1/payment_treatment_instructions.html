<b>Payment Information</b>
<ul>
    <li>In addition to the $6.00 show-up payment, one of the performance rounds will be randomly selected (with equal probability) for additional payment based on the number of keyboard tasks completed in that round.</li>
    <li>Each keyboard pair completed in that round chosen for payment will earn you an additional ${{ Constants.payment_rate }}. </li>
    <li>As an example, imagine there are only two rounds. A participant completes 706 keyboard pairs in round 1 and 500 keyboard pairs in round 2. At the end of the experiment, round 1 is chosen for payment. That participant's payment will consist of the $6.00 showup fee and ${{ Constants.payment_rate }} for every keyboard pair she completed in round 1, which is 706 pairs. So she earns ${{ Constants.payment_rate }} * 706 = $14.12 from her performance in round 1. Adding the show-up payment, she earns a total of $20.12 in the experiment.
    <li>If instead round 2 was randomly chosen for payment instead of round 1, that same participant would have earned ${{ Constants.payment_rate }} * 500 = $10.00 for completing 500 pairs in round 2, plus the show-up fee, so she would have earned $16.00 in the experiment.</li>
    <li>If you have any questions, please let the experimenter know now.</li>
</ul>
