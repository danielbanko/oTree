# Repository for my oTree Projects

oTree is a Python package used for implementing experiments. It is a tool commonly used in the fields of experimental and behavioral economics. This repository stores my oTree code for my research projects.

#TODO:
Need to keep track of all keystrokes because need to measure mistakes made.

if i run multiple sessions on same day, the data downloaded has the same exact name, so could overwrite prior data. need to fix this.

looks like first round is always practice round. need to fix it so that practice round is in addition to the number of rounds specified by num_rounds

Warning: set_final_payoff is defined but not used

make the instructions persistent across page. so participants have access

add a button that participants have to press to see the peer information (better to ensure that they read it)
