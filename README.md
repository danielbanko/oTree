# Repository for my oTree Projects

oTree is a Python package used for implementing experiments. It is a tool commonly used in the fields of experimental and behavioral economics. This repository stores my oTree code for my research projects.

#TODO:
Need to keep track of all keystrokes because need to measure mistakes made.

if i run multiple sessions on same day, the data downloaded has the same exact name, so could overwrite prior data. need to fix this.

looks like first round is always practice round. need to fix it so that practice round is in addition to the number of rounds specified by num_rounds

Warning: set_final_payoff is defined but not used

make the instructions persistent across page. so participants have access

add a button that participants have to press to see the peer information (better to ensure that they read it)

Two main issues to fix before running sessions:
Change comparison display to butera et Al (show participants how close they are?)
Change to session level assignment of FC PC and NC
Bar

Before running sessions:
Submit a preregistration

For paper:
Show using theoretical model that the predictions are ambiguous
Work on lit review (focus on the butera paper and the other paper that David mentioned barankay)
Establish that it is ego relevant and elastic. Firms will only use who relevant tasks in the real world
Can test the theory that it is ego relevant or not by adding a social component (donating to charity) condition in future study

Add more information to results page of practice round (you completed 8 pairs of keyboard presses maybe?)
Clarify in the round setup page that your decision does not affect their earnings.
Do you have a sense of what this study was about?
First screen people shouldn’t be able to advance until I say so.
Keyboard pairs were not stored in last round?
Earnings isn’t working yet.
Rounds 2 - 6 need to be recoded as performance rounds 1 - 5.
Need to add slot to put in participant label.
“Please wait for your label to be called to receive your payment.”
Bring flash drive and adapter to connect flash drive with you day of
Remember to download and save the data in your data folder and email a copy to yourself and store a copy on the hard drive.
Bring coat
Change payments so that minimum is $8 for completing task (how long does it take? Time it)

change format so that you read instructions aloud first
