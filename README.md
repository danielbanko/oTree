# Repository for my oTree Projects

oTree is a Python package used for implementing experiments. It is a tool commonly used in the fields of experimental and behavioral economics. This repository stores my oTree code for my research projects.

#TODO:
Need to keep track of all keystrokes because need to measure mistakes made.

if i run multiple sessions on same day, the data downloaded has the same exact name, so could overwrite prior data. need to fix this.

looks like first round is always practice round. need to fix it so that practice round is in addition to the number of rounds specified by num_rounds

need to ask participant to specify participant label on last page

create a button that a participant has to click in order to see the information?

Be sure to elicit beliefs about their performance and do a post survey asking how they made their decisions.

In FC group, add a button that allows people to see the information in each round or not?

What information to convey to the people in the no comparison group?

add option to stop early

make sure payment rate is 0.5 cent for each completed pair

should I tell participants how large the group size is? 

should participants only be paid for one round at random?
